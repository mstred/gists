gists

A better (unified-like) way to manage my own gists

I really liked the idea for pasting code snippets or scripts offered by Github's [Gists] (http://gists.github.com).

It's kinda boring, though, to have a single repo for each gist shared on it (IMHO). 
So by the way, this is a repo I can do the same thing, but keeping the snippets as a collection in a simple unique place
(as I thought Gists should be).
